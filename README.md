# .dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for my Arch Linux setup! :O

You'll quickly notice I gravitate toward the [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) colorscheme, if that’s your vibe too, you might enjoy this setup!

# Packages

Some of the most notable packages used in this setup are:

- i3-wm
- picom
- polybar
- rofi
- kitty
- tmux
- zsh
- neovim
- dunst

# Installation

The command below fetches the setup.sh script, which configures the environment using scripts from /scripts. You’ll need curl and bash installed. Some packages might be outdated depending on when you try it, but I’ll do my best to keep things current.

```bash
bash "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinegm/.dotfiles/master/setup.sh)"
```

Note that This setup is tailored for my machine, so there may be quirks or issues on different hardware. Feel free to reach out if you need help!
